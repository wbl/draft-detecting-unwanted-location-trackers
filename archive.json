This specification does not make it easier to discover these trackers for thieves. AirTags, Samsung Trackers, Tile, they all rely on Bluetooth. Every simple Bluetooth scanner app can find them. \r\n\r\nThe intended use-case was to find your lost valuables and that's where these devices are great at. The added protection against stalking is helpful for people who are in threat of stalking. Stalking can lead to harmful attacks and have already ended up in at least two people getting killed after they have been tracked with an AirTag. The value of any material device should never be higher than the value of human life. ",

However it should not be an excuse to ignore how other use-cases are affected.\r\n\r\nI don't think it is an either-or case, we could have both unwanted tracker detection and help on finding stolen property. Just as a very trivial example to start-off such conversation it could be made possible for authorities to recover details of the device used to disable a tracker, it it gets reported as tracking stolen property. If nothing else this could discourage theft.\r\n\r\n> This specification does not make it easier to discover these trackers for thieves. \r\n\r\nI think this is not true. This spec will make it trivially easy, by having a tracker work with any smart phone to proactively notify a thief of the tracker's presence, AND allowing it to get disabled, with zero effort on their part, no additional equipment or app required.\r\n\r\nAt the very least it seem to me the effect on this use case should be acknowledged as a side-effect.",

The threat from \"finder\" type location trackers like\r\nTiles or AirTags comes from the interaction of a number of features,\r\nspecifically:\r\n\r\n1. They are compact (thus easy to hide)\r\n2. They are cheap (thus easy to obtain)\r\n3. They take advantage of a preexisting infrastructure intended\r\n   for another purpose (the finder network)\r\n4. They have long battery lifetimes (and thus are suitable\r\n   for long-term surveillance)\r\n\r\nTo contextualize this, consider the counter example of a GPS tracker\r\nlike a Garmin inReach, which takes a GPS location and broadcasts it to\r\na satellite. These cost about $300, have battery life measured in days,\r\nand are several centimeters across, so are hard to conceal. This is\r\nmuch less useful for both covert surveillance and for finding ones\r\nown items. So, the objective of this work should be to the extent\r\npossible to prevent attacks which are cheaper than buying your\r\nown GPS tracker.\u201d",

There are several attacks here,\r\nincluding:\r\n\r\n1. Modifying an existing tage to make it nonconformant in\r\n   such a way that the countermeasures in this draft don't\r\n   work.\r\n2. Making a new tag which is nonconformant, etc.\r\n\r\nI think this framing is useful when considering two different sets\r\nof countermeasures in this design:\r\n\r\n1. The \"sound maker\" feature of having the device make noise when its\r\n   separated and moving (S 3.12.2.1) or when it is located\r\n   (S 3.12.3).\r\n\r\n2. The BT-based \"this device is following me\" feature described in\r\n   S 3.4.3.\r\n\r\nThe key point I would like to make here is that countermeasure\r\n(1) is potentially evaded without compromising the above invariants.\r\nFor instance, maybe I can take an AirTag and disable the speaker\r\nin some way but it will still work for location tracking. Or\r\nmaybe I can wrap it in some sound insulating material. Clearly I\r\ncan fix the flashing lights. None of this seems like it impacts\r\nthe basic tracking functionality, including the surveillance\r\nuse case.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, I don't think it's necessarily feasible to easily modify\r\nthe tracker to use some different protocol that would still be\r\ncompatible with tracking but harder to detect (e.g., faster ID rotation)\r\nbecause that would depend on changing the firmware. So that is\r\na harder attack to mount, especially if the firmware is signed.\r\nObviously you can burn out the radio or wrap it in a faraday cage,\r\nbut that breaks *both* tracking and unwanted tracking detection.\r\nHowever, it might be able to build a fake tag which violated\r\nthese invariants.\r\n\r\nMy point here is that detection countermeasures need to depend\r\non properties of the system that are hard to subvert while\r\nhaving it continue to be functional. \u201c",

I was trying to find out if playing sounds should be possible when the accessory is in *near-owner* state, and I found Section 3.12.3 confusing.\r\n\r\nSection 3.12.3 \"Sound Maker\" currently reads:\r\n\r\n> The accessory MUST include a sound maker (for example, a speaker) to play sound ***when in separated state***, either periodically or when motion is detected.\r\n> It MUST ***also*** play sound when a non-owner tries to locate the accessory by initiating a play sound command from a non-owner device when the accessory is in range and connectable through Bluetooth LE.\r\n\r\nThis section initially gave me the impression that playing sounds is always possible when in-range (both near-owner and separated state), and it seemed to contradict the statement in 3.12.4. Perhaps the Sound Maker section could emphasise that non-owner initiated sounds require the separated state (\"when the accessory is in range and ~connectable through Bluetooth LE~ *in separated mode.*\")\r\n\r\nThis issue seems to be the right place to share my confusion :-)",

It was much easier on Android, and unless it has changed recently there is no way to actively scan for AirTags on iOS (although it was in a beta at some point?). There are many contexts where a user would prefer to be able to actively scan their environment for unwanted trackers, rather than relying on a passive notification (which can take hours to occur).\r\n\r\nI understand that platform issues are out of scope for this document, so I'll focus my other comments more specifically here too. Could the authors share the above concerns/suggestions with the relevant iOS team?\r\n\r\nThis document proposes an advertisement payload (section 3.4) that would allow \"platforms to easily scan for and detect the location-enabled Bluetooth advertisement\" (section 3.6). From what I can tell this is close to what AirTags already do. A few questions/comments:\r\n\r\n- Will the service data TLV be standardized across location trackers? (I'm assuming yes but part of that section is marked TODO)\r\n- It would be helpful to have some context on what existing location trackers already do and how/whether this is codification of what existing trackers e.g. AirTags already do, vs. a new proposed advertisement packet. I think the existing one works fine but the iOS platform is an issue for active scanning right now as I discuss above.\r\n- I think section 6 should encourage (if not require) platforms to support both active and passive scanning. There should also be some discussion about appropriate time frames for passive notification (getting notified hours later is not helpful, but at the same time false positives need to be avoided).\r\n",

Nevertheless, there may exist different target groups that have different needs. For example, a police officer can be required to perform a detailed scan of the environment to detect any nearby trackers. It would be possible for a third-party developer to implement such a service and offer it on the App Store / Google Play Store. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, users might need more detailed settings. A user that has previously experienced stalking might want to be alerted earlier and is okay with experiencing a higher false-positive rate. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose the added changes to ensure that no platform or manufacturer limits access to the Bluetooth accessories following this specification.

This PR provides addresses the following:\r\n\r\n1. Disambiguate \"Pairing\" and use \"association\" instead where applicable (issue #17 ).\r\n2. Not require a given MAC address format (issue #18 ).\r\n3. When not in separated mode, require to rotate the MAC \"at least every 120 minutes\" instead of \"every 15 minutes\": the rational is that 120 should be good enough so we don't really need to require 15 minutes (of course 15 mn would be allowed).\r\n4. Make the \"Paired (Associated) Accessory Identification\" mandatory instead of optional for platforms to support: the rational is that the experience would be poor if this is not supported by platforms.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJosselin\r\n",
